Heavy-flavour production in pp collisions provides important tests of our understanding of various aspects of QCD.
The heavy-quark mass acts as a long distance cut-off so that the partonic hard-scattering process can be calculated
in the framework of perturbative QCD down to low transverse momenta. When the heavy-quark pair forms a quarkonium bound
state, this process is non-perturbative as it involves long distances and soft momentum scales. Therefore, the detailed
study of heavy-flavour production and the comparison to experimental data provides an important testing ground for
both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of QCD calculations.

%% Upsilon discovery

The $\Upsilon$ meson was discovered by E288 collaboration at Fermilab in 400 GeV proton nucleus
collisions in 1977~\cite{PhysRevLett.39.252}.
%%Upsilon measurements at Tevatron
The Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) reports $\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(3S) 
differential (d$^{2}\sigma$/dp$_{T}$dy) and integrated cross sections in p$\overline{\rm p}$ collisions at
$\surd$s = 1.8 TeV~\cite{CDF:1995gwi}. The three resonances were reconstructed through the decay of
$\Upsilon$(nS) to $\mu^{+}$ and $\mu^{-}$. The differential (d$^{2}\sigma$/dp$_{T}$dy) and integrated
cross sections have measured in the range 0$\textless$p$_{T}\textless$16 GeV/c for $\Upsilon$(1S) and in the range
0$\textless$p$_{T}\textless$10 GeV/c for $\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(3S). Table~\ref{Tab:YCrossCDF95} summarizes
the 1995 CDF Run I cross section measurement~\cite{CDF:1995gwi}.

an integrated luminosity of 77 pb$^{-1}$~\cite{CDF:2001fdy}. The cross section results from the CDF

The next set of measurements were done at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
$\surd$s = 7 TeV in pp collisions. CMS measured the $\Upsilon$ cross section in 2011 with
a luminosity of 3.1 pb$^{-1}$, rapidity range $|y|\textless$ 2, and p$_{T} \textless$ 30

Several $\Upsilon$ polarization measurements have now also been made. With a luminosity
of 77 pb$^{-1}$, CDF Run I measured the $\Upsilon$(1S) polarization in 2002 at $\surd$s =
1.8 TeV with $|y|\textless$ 0.4 and found the $\Upsilon$(1S) to be unpolarized~\cite{CDF:2001fdy}.
At $\surd$ s = 1.96 TeV, D0 Run II measured the $\Upsilon$(1S) and $\Upsilon$(2S) polarization in
2008 in a sample with luminosity of 1.3 fb$^{-1}$~\cite{D0:2008yos}. The measurement done by D0 found
longitudinal polarization for the $\Upsilon$(1S)~\cite{D0:2008yos}. However, these first polarizations
measurements were only measured in one reference frame, and the results could be biased due to the choice
of the reference frame and the acceptance of the detector. Newer measurements were done in multiple
reference frames and include the calculation of the frame invariant parameter to
prevent bias from detector acceptance with the choice of a single reference frame.


The first full polarization for all $\Upsilon$(nS) states was measured in 2012 by CDF Run
II at $\surd$ s = 1.96 TeV~\cite{CDF:2011ag}. The CDF Run II measurement had a luminosity of 6.7 fb$^{-1}$
with $|y|\textless$ 0.6 and p$_{T}\textless$ 40 GeV and also found no evidence for
polarization~\cite{CDF:2011ag}. CMS measured the $\Upsilon$(nS) polarization in 2013 using a luminosity
of 4.9 fb$^{-1}$ at $\surd$ s = 7 TeV~\cite{CMS:2012bpf}. The CMS polarization measurement found the $\Upsilon$
to be unpolarized, and suggested that this could be a result of including $\Upsilon$ produced
in feeddown from an excited state~\cite{CMS:2012bpf}. Improved $\Upsilon$ polarization measurements with lower
uncertainties will allow theories to develop to provide insight into the quarkonium production
mechanism.



%%Upsilon measurements at RHIC



%%Upsilon at LHC
The study of bottomonium production at LHC energies offers many advantages. First, there is no beauty feed-down. Second,
owing to their larger masses, their decay products - usually leptons - are more energetic and more easily detectable
(detector acceptance, trigger bandwidth, etc.). Third, the existence of three sets of bottomonia with their principal
quantum number n = 1, 2, 3 below the open-beauty threshold offers a wider variety of states that can be detected in
the dilepton decay channel this, however, introduces a complicated feed-down pattern.



With the advent of the LHC, the study of $\Upsilon$ production has become more
accessible than ever. The $\Upsilon$ production pattern at the LHC differs from that
of the lighter $\psi^{'}$s. The $\Upsilon^{'}$s having three states with different binding
energies are thus far richer probes of the QCD dynamics in pp and PbPb collisions than
the charmonia. It is therefore important to achieve a good understanding of their
production mechanism in the vacuum as well as of how the nuclear effects in proton-nucleus
collisions affect them. In this section we will give an overview of measurements of $\Upsilon$
production in pp collisions at LHC. 

The measurements of $\Upsilon$(1S,2S,3S) production in pp collisions at the unprecedented C.M. energies
of 2.76, 5.02, 7, 8, and 13 TeV have been undertaken, within the rapidity window -2.4$<$ y $<$ 4.5
and the dimuon momentum range of p$_{T}<$ 100 GeV/c at LHC by ALICE~\cite{ATLAS:2011nal,ATLAS:2012lmu}, ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS:2011nal,ATLAS:2012lmu},
CMS~\cite{CMS:2013qur,CMS:2017dju} and LHCb collaborations.

In addition, the angular distribution of the muons produced in the $\Upsilon$(1S, 2S, 3S) decays has
been analyzed in different reference frames to determine the polarization parameters. From the results
of CMS and LHCb, $\Upsilon$(1S, 2S, 3S) polarization parameters are all so close to zero that polarizations
can be neglected. The measurements of these cross sections and polarizations have shed light on the
$\Upsilon$(1S, 2S, 3S) production mechanisms in pp collisions.
Analysis of new LHC data will extend the reach of the kinematics to test the NRQCD with
higher-order corrections which becomes more sensitive with the increase of p$_{T}$,












\section{Bottomonia production mechanism in p-p collisions}
\label{sec:Bottomonia_pp_th}


In general one can subdivide the quarkonia production process into two major parts

\begin{enumerate}
\item Production of a heavy quark pair in hard collisions.
\item Formation of quarkonia out of the two heavy quarks.
\end{enumerate}


The massive quarks (with $m_c\sim 1.6$ GeV/$c^2$, $m_b\sim 4.5$ GeV/$c^2$) are produced
in initial stages in hadronic collision with high momentum transfer and thus
can be treated perturbatively~\cite{Nason:1989zy}. The emergence of quarkonia
out of the two massive quarks, on the other hand can only be described non-perturbatively using different
models~\cite{Bodwin:1994jh,Brambilla:2014jmp}.
The Colour Singlet Model (CSM)~\cite{Einhorn:1975ua,Berger:1980ni},
Colour Evaporation Model (CEM)~\cite{Fritzsch:1977ay,Amundson:1995em}, the Fragmentation Scheme and 
the NRQCD factorisation formalism are some of the well established models for quarkonia production.


Due to the high mass of the heavy quarks they are produced in the initial
collisions as their production requires sufficiently high momentum 
transfers. For this reason the heavy quark production
is a hard process that can be treated perturbatively.
The hadronic cross section in $pp$ collisions can
be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{pp}(s,m^2) & = & \sum_{i,j = q, \overline q, g} 
\int dx_1 \, dx_2 \, 
f_i^p (x_1,\mu_F^2) \,
f_j^p(x_2,\mu_F^2) \, \widehat{\sigma}_{ij}(s,m^2,\mu_F^2,\mu_R^2)
\label{sigpp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the fractional momenta carried by the colliding
partons and $f_i^p$ are the proton parton densities.
The total partonic cross section has been completely calculated up to NLO
\cite{Nason:1987xz,Nason:1989zy}. The partonic cross section is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\sigma}_{ij}(s,m,\mu_F^2,\mu_R^2) & = & 
\frac{\alpha_s^2(\mu_R^2)}{m^2}
\left\{ f^{(0,0)}_{ij}(\rho) \right. \nonumber \\
 & + & \left. 4\pi \alpha_s(\mu_R^2) \left[f^{(1,0)}_{ij}(\rho) + 
f^{(1,1)}_{ij}(\rho)\ln\bigg(\frac{\mu_F^2}{m^2} \bigg) \right] 
+ {\cal O}(\alpha_s^2) \right\}
\,\, 
\label{sigpart}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\rho = 4m^2/s$ and 
$f_{ij}^{(k,l)}$ are the scaling functions to NLO \cite{Nason:1987xz,Nason:1989zy}. 
At small $\rho$, the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ and ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$
$q \overline q$ and the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ $gg$ scaling functions 
become small while the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^3)$ $gg$ and $qg$ scaling functions
plateau at finite values.  Thus, at collider energies, the total cross sections
are primarily dependent on the small $x$ parton densities and phase space.
The total cross section does not depend on any kinematic variables, 
only on the quark mass, $m$, and the renormalization and factorization scales with central
value $\mu_{R,F} =\mu_0 = m$.


The nonperturbative evolution of the $Q\bar Q$ pair into a quarkonium
has been discussed extensively in terms of models and in terms of the
language of effective theories of QCD
\cite{Bodwin:1994jh,Brambilla:2004wf}. Different
treatments of this evolution have led to various theoretical models for
inclusive quarkonium production. Most notable among these are the color-singlet
model (CSM), the color-evaporation model (CEM) and the non-relativistic QCD
(NRQCD) factorization approach. In this review we will mainly discuss the NRQCD 
approach, as theoretically, it is the most modern and acceptable one. However,
we will touch upon CSM and CEM briefly. 





\subsection{The color singlet model}


The color singlet model (CSM) was first proposed shortly after the discovery of the 
$\Jpsi$~\cite{Einhorn:1975ua,Ellis:1976fj,Carlson:1976cd,Berger:1980ni}.
In this model, it is assumed that the $Q\bar Q$ pair that evolves into
the quarkonium is in a color-singlet state and that it has the same spin
and angular-momentum quantum numbers as the quarkonium. In the CSM, the
production rate for each quarkonium state is related to the absolute
values of the color-singlet $Q\bar Q$ wave function and its derivatives,
evaluated at zero $Q\bar Q$ separation. These quantities can be
extracted by comparing theoretical expressions for quarkonium decay
rates in the CSM with experimental measurements. Once this extraction
has been carried out, the CSM has no free parameters. The CSM was
successful in predicting quarkonium production rates at relatively low
energy \cite{Schuler:1994hy}. Recently, it has been found that, at high
energies, very large corrections to the CSM appear at next-to-leading
order (NLO) and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in $\alpha_s$
\cite{Artoisenet:2007xi,Campbell:2007ws,Artoisenet:2008fc}.
Consequently, the possibility that the CSM might embody an important 
production mechanism at high energies has re-emerged. 
However, given the very large corrections at
NLO and NNLO, it is not clear that the perturbative expansion in
$\alpha_s$ is convergent. 
%Furthermore, in the production and decay of
%$P$-wave and higher-orbital-angular-momentum quarkonium states, the CSM
%is known to be inconsistent because it leads to uncanceled infrared
%divergences. (See Ref.~\cite{Brambilla:2004wf} and references therein.)
%The NRQCD factorization approach encompasses
%the color-singlet model, but goes beyond it.

\subsection{The color evaporation model}  
\label{prod_sec:CEM}

The CEM~\cite{Fritzsch:1977ay,Amundson:1995em,Amundson:1996qr}
is motivated by the principle of quark-hadron duality. In the CEM, it
is assumed that every produced $\QQbar$ pair evolves into a quarkonium
if it has an invariant mass that is less than the threshold for
producing a pair of open-flavor heavy mesons. It is further assumed that
the nonperturbative probability for the $\QQbar$ pair to evolve into a
quarkonium state $H$ is given by a constant $F_H$ that is
energy-momentum and process independent. Once $F_H$ has been fixed by
comparison with the measured total cross section for the production of
the quarkonium $H$, the CEM can predict, with no additional free
parameters, the momentum distribution of the quarkonium production rate. The
CEM predictions provide good descriptions of the CDF data for $\Jpsi$,
$\psi(2S)$, and $\chi_{c}$ production at $\sqrt{s}=1.8$~TeV
\cite{Amundson:1996qr}. 

%In Ref.~\cite{Bodwin:2005hm}, the CEM
%predictions are fit to the CDF data for $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, and
%$\chi_{cJ}$ production at $\sqrt{s}=1.8$~TeV \cite{Abe:1997yz}. The
%quality of these fits is generally poor, with $\chi^2/\hbox{d.o.f.}$ for
%the $J/\psi$ fits of about $7$--$8$ without initial-state $k_T$ smearing and
%$2$--$4.5$ with initial-state $k_T$ smearing. In contrast, the NRQCD
%factorization approach, which we are about to describe, yields fits to
%the CDF $J/\psi$ data with $\chi^2/\hbox{d.o.f.}$ of about $1$.

The heavy quark production cross section are calculated to NLO in pQCD  
using the CT10 parton densities \cite{Lai:2010vv}. The mass and scale parameters used 
for open and hidden heavy flavor production are obtained by fitting the energy dependence 
of open heavy flavor production to the measured total cross sections~\cite{Nelson:2012bc}.
%Those obtained for open charm are $m_c = 1.27 \pm 0.09$~GeV,
%$\mu_F/m_{T\,c} = 2.10 ^{+2.55}_{-0.85}$, and $\mu_R/m_{T\, c} = 1.60 ^{+0.11}_{-0.12}$~\cite{Nelson:2012bc}. 
The botttom quark mass and scale parameters are $m_b = 4.65 \pm 0.09$ GeV,
$\mu_F/m_{T\, b} = 1.40^{+0.75}_{-0.47}$, and $\mu_R/m_{T\, b} = 1.10^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$.
The quarkonium production cross sections are calculated in the color evaporation model with
normalizations determined from fitting the scale parameter to the shape of the energy-dependent
cross sections~\cite{Nelson:2012bc}.
% The resulting uncertainty bands are smaller 
%than those obtained with the fiducial parameters used in Ref.~\cite{Cacciari:2005rk}.
%We note that the new results are within the uncertainties of those Ref.~\cite{Cacciari:2005rk}.  
%Indeed, the charm cross sections reported at the LHC agree
%better with the new values of the mass and scale than the central value of $m_c = 1.5$ GeV,
%$\mu_F/m_T = \mu_R/m_T = 1$.
The central EPS09 NLO parameter set~\cite{Eskola:2009uj} is used to 
calculate the modifications of the parton distribution functions (nPDF) in 
Pb+Pb collisions, referred as cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects.
The production cross sections for heavy flavor and quarkonia at $\sqrt{s_{_{_{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 
TeV \cite{Kumar:2012qx} are given in Table~\ref{NLOcros}.  The yields in a minimum bias 
Pb+Pb event is obtained from the per nucleon cross
section, $\sigma_{\rm PbPb}$, in Table~\ref{NLOcros}, as
\begin{eqnarray}
N = {A^2 \sigma_{\rm PbPb} \over  
\sigma_{\rm PbPb}^{\rm tot}} \, \, .
\end{eqnarray}
 At 2.76 TeV, the total Pb+Pb cross section, $\sigma_{\rm PbPb}^{\rm tot}$, 
is 7.65 b \cite{Chatrchyan:2011sx}.

\subsection{The NRQCD factorization approach}


In the framework of CSM, the $Q\bar{Q}$ pair, eventually evolving into the quarkonium,
is assumed to be in Colour Singlet (CS) state and that has spin and 
angular momentum same as that of quarkonium.
Apart from comprising of the CSM, the NRQCD factorisation approach incorporates 
the Colour Octet (CO) states as well.

In the formalism of the NRQCD factorisation approach, the evolution probability of $Q\bar{Q}$
pair into a state of quarkonium is expressed as matrix elements of NRQCD operators expanded
in terms of heavy quark velocity $v$ (for $v\ll$1)~\cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.
%The NRQCD formalism based on an effective field 
%theory framework, separates the short distance annihilation scale of heavy 
%quarkonium states from long distance ones corresponding to quarkonium structure.
The factorisation formulae were then used to calculate production cross-sections
and decay rates of quarkonia states.
%S-wave states at Next to leading order (NLO) and of P-wave
%states at Leading order (LO).
The full structure of the $Q\bar{Q}$ Fock space
is considered and spanned by $n$=$^{2s+1}L_J^{[a]}$ state where $s$
is the spin, $L$ is the orbital angular momentum, $J$ is the total angular momentum
and $a$ (colour multiplicity) = 1 for CS and 8 for CO states. 
The produced CO states of $Q\bar{Q}$ pair at short distances emerge as 
CS quarkonia by emitting soft gluons non-perturbatively.
%In case of S-wave quarkonia, the CSM is retrieved in the limit of $v\rightarrow$0.
%The short distance cross-sections are obtained theoretically
%using methods of perturbative QCD (pQCD). The long distance matrix elements
%(LDME) that correspond to the probability of 
%$Q\bar{Q}$ pair to emerge as quarkonium are extracted by fitting the measured cross-section
%data.

There have been several works on bottomonia production based on
NRQCD formalism \cite{Domenech:1999qg,Domenech:2000ri,Braaten:2000cm,Gong:2010bk,Sharma:2012dy}.
%In Ref.~\cite{Domenech:1999qg}, a Monte Carlo framework has first
%been employed with CO mechanism for inclusive bottomonia production and few
%NRQCD CO matrix elements for $\Upsilon$(1S) have been extracted at the Tevatron energy. 
%The study has been extended to the whole $\Upsilon$(nS) family in Ref.~\cite{Domenech:2000ri}
%to find CO matrix elements using CDF measurements at Tevatron.
%In Ref.~\cite{Braaten:2000cm} the CO matrix elements are obtained for $\Upsilon$(nS) family
%and the feed downs from $\chi_{b}$(1P) and $\chi_{b}$(2P) to $\Upsilon$(1S) have been 
%considered.
%In Ref.~\cite{Gong:2010bk}, the $\Upsilon$ production has been obtained via
%S-wave CO states calculated at Next to Leading Order (NLO). The LDMEs are obtained
%by fitting the Tevatron data. The ratios of NLO to LO total cross-sections
%have been obtained at Tevatron and LHC energies. Polarisation of inclusive
%$\Upsilon$ has been obtained albeit with large uncertainties.
%In Ref.~\cite{Sharma:2012dy} both CS and CO states along with
%feed down contributions from higher states have been considered to study the
%quarkonia yields for RHIC and LHC energies.
%Using Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism, an extension of the NRQCD prediction
%has been carried forward for heavy quarkonium production
%at low $p_T$ by considering soft gluon resummation at all orders in Ref.~\cite{Sun:2012vc}.
Both production and polarisation of $\Upsilon$(nS) at NLO have been discussed in 
Ref.~\cite{Gong:2013qka} within the framework of NRQCD. The CO matrix elements are obtained
by fitting with experimental data. The study is updated in Ref.~\cite{Feng:2015wka} by considering
feed down from $\chi_{bJ}$(mP) states in $\Upsilon$(nS) production. The yields and
polarisations of $\Upsilon$(nS) measured at Tevatron and LHC are well explained by this work.
The NLO study in Ref.~\cite{Han:2014kxa} describes the yields and polarisations of
$\Upsilon$(nS) at LHC which includes feed down contributions from
higher states. In Ref.~\cite{Yu:2017pot}, production cross-section for $\Upsilon$(nS),
$\chi_{bJ}$, $\eta_b$ and $h_b$ have been calculated using NRQCD, as produced in hard
photo production and fragmentation processes at LHC energies. 

A LO NRQCD analyis is useful as it is straightforward and unique and once the parameters are
obtained by fitting over large datasets it has excellent predictability power for unknown cross
sections.
 It is shown that there is a large difference amoung the LDMEs obtained by different
analysis at NLO.
The LO NRQCD calculations for the differential production
cross-sections of $\Upsilon$ states in p+p collisions also have been presented.
%The NRQCD formalism is described
%briefly in Section~\ref{sec:formalism}. 
A large set of data from Tevatron~\cite{Acosta:2001gv} and
LHC~\cite{LHCb:2012aa,Khachatryan:2015qpa,Aad:2012dlq,Chatrchyan:2013yna,Sirunyan:2017qdw} 
is used to extract the LDMEs required for the $\Upsilon$ production.
%and then results are
%presented in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
%A comparison of the obtained LDMEs with the
%previous NRQCD studies both at LO and NLO has been made.
%The summary 
%of our findings are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:summary}. An updated QCD LO study on the
%bottomonia hadroproduction is useful as it provides a reference for comparison
%with NLO calculations. 

The processes that govern the differential
production of heavy mesons like bottomonium, as functions of $p_T$ are mostly
2$\rightarrow$2 operations. These processes can be denoted generically by 
$i+j\rightarrow \Upsilon +X$, where $i$ and $j$ are the incident light partons,
$\Upsilon$ is the heavy meson and $X$ is final state light parton.
The double differential cross-section as a function of $p_T$ and rapidity ($y$) of 
the heavy meson can be written as~\cite{Kumar:2016ojy},
\begin{eqnarray}
  \nonumber
  E\,\frac{d^3\sigma^{\Upsilon} }{d^3p} &=& \sum_{i,j} \int dx_1 dx_2 f_{i/p}(x_1,\mu_F^2)
  f_{i/p}(x_2,\mu_F^2) \delta(s+u+t-m^2) {\hat{s} \over \pi} \, \frac{d\sigma}{d\hat{t}}
  \label{eq4}
\end{eqnarray}
where, $f_{i/p}$($f_{j/p}$) are the colliding parton $(i(j))$ distribution functions in
the incident protons. They depend on the fractions $x_1$($x2$), of the total momentum
carried by the incident partons and the scale of factorisation $\mu_F$.
Here $\sqrt{s}$ represents the total center of mass energy of the pp system and $m_T~(=\mu_F)$ stands for
the transverse mass, $m_T^2=p_T^2 + M^2$ of the quarkonium.
The ${d\sigma}/{d\hat{t}}$ in Eq.~\ref{eq4} is the parton level cross-section and is
defined as~\cite{Bodwin:1994jh},
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\hat{t}} = \frac{d\sigma}{d\hat{t}}(ab\rightarrow Q\bar{Q}(^{2s+1}L_J)+X)
  M_L(Q\bar{Q}(^{2s+1}L_J)\rightarrow \Upsilon)
  \label{eq6}
\end{equation}
The first term in RHS is the short distance contribution, that corresponds to the $Q\bar{Q}$
pair production in specific colour and spin configuration and is calculable using 
perturbative QCD (pQCD)~\cite{Braaten:2000cm,Baier:1983va,Humpert:1986cy,Gastmans:1987be,Cho:1995vh,Cho:1995ce}.
The other term in the RHS of Eq.(\ref{eq6}) is the Long Distance Matrix Element (LDME)
and refers to the probability of the $Q\bar{Q}$ state to convert into a quarkonium state.
They are determined by contrasting with experimental observations.

The NRQCD formalism provides an adequate procedure to estimate a quantity as an expansion in 
heavy quark relative velocity, $v$ inside $Q\bar{Q}$ bound state. The LDME in Eq.(\ref{eq6})
do scale with definitive power in $v$. The quarkonium yield depends on the $^3S_1^{[1]}$ 
and $^3P_J^{[1]}$(J=0,1,2) CS states and $^1S_0^{[8]}$, $^3S_1^{[8]}$ and $^3P_J^{[8]}$
CO states in the limit $v\ll 1$.
%The quantity in the $[]$ stands for angular momentum
%quantum numbers of the meson in Fock expansion, whereas
The superscripts in square brackets represent the colour structure of the bound state,
1 for the CS and 8 for the CO.


%It is assumed that there is no significant feed down effect in $\Upsilon$(3S) from
%higher mass states like $\chi_{bJ}$(3P).

We require both CS and CO matrix elements in order to get theoretical
predictions for the production of bottomonia at the Tevatron and LHC energies.
The corresponding expressions and
numerical values for CS states are obtained from Ref.~\cite{Braaten:2000cm}.
The CO states, on the other hand, cannot be directly connected to the non-relativistic
wavefunctions of heavy mesons,
as these are associated with a higher Fock state. Experimentally measured data sets are 
therefore employed to obtain them as in Refs.~\cite{Braaten:2000cm,Cho:1995vh,Cho:1995ce}. 
%The CS operators along with their theoretical values
%and the CO operators to be fitted are listed in Table~\ref{CSCO},
%where, $n$=1,2,3.
For the CO elements related to p-wave states, needed as the 
feed down contributions, we have used values obtained by Ref.~\cite{Sharma:2012dy,Feng:2015wka} for the 
present purpose. In our calculations, we have used
%CTEQ6L parametrisation \cite{Lai:2010vv} for parton distribution functions and
CT18NLO parametrisation~\cite{Hou:2019efy} for parton distribution functions and 
the bottom quark mass $m_b$ is taken to be 4.88 GeV.

      in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in central rapidities, as a function of
      transverse momentum compared with the measured data at CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2017qdw}
      experiment. The left figure shows relative contributions in $\Upsilon$(1S) from
      singlet and octet states as well as from feeddown. The right figure shows the sum
      of all contributions for all the 3 states where the results for $\Upsilon$(1S) and

Figure~\ref{Fig:SigmaYnSCMS7TeV} shows the NRQCD calculations of production cross-section of $\Upsilon$(nS) in
      p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, as a function of transverse momentum compared with
      the measured data by ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2012dlq} in left figure and CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013yna}
      in right figure. The cross-section of $\Upsilon$(1S) and $\Upsilon$(2S) as well as
      calculations are shifted vertically by a constant factor for better visibility.

  
Table~\ref{LDMEsY1S} shows our results for $\Upsilon$(1S) parameters along with
the results from different groups. The individual values of LDMEs are in agreement with
the values from previous works but with considerable reduction in 
errors upon inclusion of 13 TeV data sets from CMS.

We have presented NRQCD calculations for the differential production 
cross-sections of $\Upsilon$ states in  p+p collisions.  Measured transverse momentum
distributions of $\Upsilon$(3S), 
$\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(1S) in p +{$\bar {\rm p}$} collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 1.8 TeV and in 
p+p collisions at 7 TeV and 13 TeV are used to constrain the LDMEs. All the relevant feeddown
contributions from higher mass states including the $\chi_{b}$(3P) are taken in to account.
The calculations for  $\Upsilon$(3S), $\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(1S) are compared with 
the measured data at Tevatron and LHC. The formalism provides  very good description of the data in 
large transverse momentum range at different collision energy. 
%The values of LDMEs are used to predict the charmonia cross-sections in p+p collisions 
%at 13 and 5 TeV in kinematic bins relevant for LHC detectors. 
We compare the LDMEs for bottomonia obtained in this analysis with the results from earlier works.
At high $p_T$, the colour singlet contribution is very small and LHC data in large $p_T$ range 
help to constrain the relative contributions of different colour octet contributions.


These values will be useful for predictions
of quarkonia cross-section and for the purpose of a comparison with those obtained using the NLO formulations.
