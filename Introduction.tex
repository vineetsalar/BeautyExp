\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}


The strong interaction amoung quarks and gluons is described by
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) that has two aspects; asymptotic freedom at short distance
and colour confinement at long distances.
At short distance perturbative methods are well applied but confinement is a
non-perturbative phenomenon which is not very well understood yet. 
The study of quarkonia ($Q\bar{Q}$) serves as an effective 
tool to look at  both of these perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of QCD.
%The quarkonia states differ from most other hadrons due to the small velocity, $v$ of the massive
%constituents and thus can be treated using non-relativistic formalism~\cite{Povh:1995mua,Ikhdair:2005jf}. 
%In a simple picture, one can think of a quarkonium as a heavy quark pair ($Q\bar{Q}$) bound
%in a colour singlet state by some effective potential interaction, where the constituents are 
%separated by distances much smaller than $1/\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ where $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$
%is the QCD scale.
%This interaction gets screened 
%in the presence of a deconfined medium like Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), causing 
%the bound state to melt away and thus the quarkonia yields are suppressed in the 
%heavy ion collisions. This makes quarkonia an important probe of QGP. However cold nuclear matter 
%effects such as modification of parton distribution functions of nucleons inside nucleus also 
%affect their yields.

It is expected that strongly interacting matter shows qualitatively
new behavior at temperatures and/or densities which are
comparable to or larger than the typical hadronic scale.
It has been argued that under such extreme conditions
deconfinement of quarks and gluons should set in and the 
thermodynamics of strongly-interacting matter could then
be understood in terms of these elementary degrees of freedom.
This new form of matter is called
{\em quark-gluon plasma}~\cite{Shuryak:1980tp,Satz:2011wf}, or QGP.
The existence of such a transition has indeed been demonstrated 
from first principles using simulations of lattice QCD.
The deconfinement transition and the properties of hot, strongly-interacting 
matter can be studied experimentally in heavy-ion collisions~\cite{Satz:2000bn}. 
A significant part of the extensive experimental heavy-ion
program is dedicated to measuring quarkonium yields since Matsui and Satz
suggested that quarkonium suppression could be a signature of 
deconfinement~\cite{Matsui:1986dk}.
In fact, the observation of anomalous suppression was considered to be
a key signature of deconfinement at SPS energies~\cite{Kluberg:2005yh}.

One of the great opportunities of the 
LHC heavy-ion program is the ability to study bottomonium yields. 
From a theoretical perspective, bottomonium is an important and clean probe 
for at least two reasons. 
First, the effective field theory approach, which provides a link to first 
principles QCD, is more applicable for bottomonium due to better separation of 
scales and higher dissociation temperatures. Second, the heavier bottom quark 
mass reduces the importance of statistical recombination effects.
Experimentally it has less background contribution and is easy to reconstruct. 
All these properties make bottomonium a good probe of 
QGP formation in heavy ion collisions.


There have been immense experimental~\cite{Sirunyan:2017isk,Sirunyan:2017lzi,Sirunyan:2018nsz,Acharya:2019iur,Acharya:2018mni}
and theoretical works~\cite{Strickland:2011mw,Song:2011nu,Kumar:2014kfa,Kumar:2019xdj} on
quarkonia modifications in PbPb collisions.
One of the most prominent signatures of QGP
formation is that the production of quarkonia, the bound states of a heavy quark and its antiquark,
is suppressed with respect to expectations from scaling the yields in proton-proton collisions
by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon
(NN) collisions.
 The extent of the quarkonia suppression is
expected to be sequentially ordered by the binding energies of the quarkonia states. Because of
the binding energy
dependence of the screening, the bottomonium states ($\Upsilon$(1S), $\Upsilon$(2S),
$\Upsilon$(3S), $\chi_{b}$, etc.) are particularly useful probes to understand the color screening
properties 
of the QGP. The sequential suppression of the yield of $\Upsilon$(nS) states was first observed by
CMS at $\sNN =$2.76 TeV~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011pe,Chatrchyan:2012lxa}. More recently, results with improved
statistical precision have been reported by both the ALICE~\cite{ALICE:2018wzm}
and CMS Collaborations ~\cite{Sirunyan:2017lzi,Sirunyan:2018nsz} at $\sNN =$5.02.
The suppression of the $\Upsilon$(1S)
meson has also been studied at $\sNN =$200 GeV at RHIC~\cite{STAR:2013kwk} although the
bottomonia production cross section is small at lower energies. 

In this writeup we review experimental and theoretical aspects of bottomomia production in pp, pA
and AA collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.
